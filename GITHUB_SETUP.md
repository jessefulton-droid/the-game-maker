# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `the-game-maker`
   - **Description**: "AI-powered app that turns children's books into playable games using agent-based architecture"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-game-maker.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

Or if you use SSH:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/the-game-maker.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

Visit your repository at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-game-maker
```

You should see all your files and the README.md will display automatically!

## 📋 What's Been Committed

Your initial commit includes:
- ✅ 38 files (7,691 lines added)
- ✅ Complete agent architecture
- ✅ All 7 screens
- ✅ All components and services
- ✅ Game templates
- ✅ Documentation (5 markdown files)
- ✅ .gitignore (protects .env and node_modules)

## 🔒 Security Note

Your `.env` file is in `.gitignore`, so your API key is **NOT** included in the repo. This is good!

When others clone your repo, they'll need to:
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`
2. Add their own `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

## 📝 Future Commits

When you make changes:

```bash
# Check what changed
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Add feature: description of what you added"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## 🎯 Recommended Repository Settings

After pushing, consider:

1. **Add Topics**: Go to repo settings → Add topics
   - `react-native`
   - `expo`
   - `ai-agents`
   - `langchain`
   - `claude`
   - `phaser`

2. **Add a Description**: Short tagline for your repo
